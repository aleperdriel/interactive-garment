## Overview
This project uses two **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors** to measure distance and control two **servo motors** accordingly. The servos adjust their position based on the detected distance, within a range of **0Â° to 75Â°**.
An update is a version of the same circuit using Time Of Flight (ToF) sensors.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino Uno** (or compatible board)
- **2x HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors**
- **2x Servo motors**
- Jumper wires
- (Optional) External 5V power supply for servos (recommended for stability)

## Wiring Instructions
| Component  | Arduino Pin |
|------------|------------|
| HC-SR04 #1 TRIG | 2 |
| HC-SR04 #1 ECHO | 3 |
| HC-SR04 #2 TRIG | 4 |
| HC-SR04 #2 ECHO | 5 |
| Servo #1 Signal | 9 |
| Servo #2 Signal | 10 |
| HC-SR04 VCC | 5V |
| HC-SR04 GND | GND |
| Servo Power | 5V / External 6V |
| Servo GND | GND |

> **Note:** If using an external power source for the servos, connect **all GNDs together** to avoid floating ground issues.

## Installation & Usage
1. **Connect the hardware** following the wiring diagram above.
2. **Upload the Arduino code** using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Open Serial Monitor** (115200 baud) to view sensor readings and servo positions.
4. **Place objects in front of the sensors** to see servos respond accordingly.

## How It Works
- The **ultrasonic sensors** measure the distance of nearby objects.
- The **distance is mapped** to a servo angle between **0Â° and 75Â°**.
- Each **servo moves** in real-time based on its corresponding sensor's readings.
- **Out-of-range values** (less than 2cm or more than 400cm) are ignored.

## Code Explanation
- **`trigPins[]` & `echoPins[]`**: Define TRIG and ECHO pins for both sensors.
- **`servoPins[]`**: Define control pins for the servos.
- **`map(constrain(distance, 5, 100), 5, 100, 0, 75)`**: Converts distance into a limited servo angle.
- **`pulseIn(echoPins[i], HIGH, 20000);`**: Reads the ultrasonic signal with a timeout to prevent blocking.

## Troubleshooting
- **No movement?** Check servo wiring and power supply.
- **Unstable servo?** Use an external 5-6V power source.
- **Incorrect distance readings?** Ensure ultrasonic sensors are positioned correctly.
